    <h1>Proxima Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>
        To allow you to obtain the Indication of the next passages for the International Space Station, I may require you to
        obtain your localization. The information that I request will be retained on your device and is not collected by me in
        any way.
    </p>
    <p>
        Beyond the information Apple provides to developers that you can decide to provide, the Proxima app also uses <a href="https://firebase.google.com/" target="_blank">Firebase
        Services</a> within the app (Firebase's Privacy Policy can be found <a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy" target="_blank">here</a>, note that Proxima app only uses a small subset of
        Firebase's many services).
        This helps to send notification for an event. The information collected is anonymous and the Proxima app does not sell
        or rent your data, and the anonymous information is only collected to help make the app better.
    </p>
    <p>
        By using the Proxima app, you're subject to Privacy Policy of any websites you visit/encounter/use within the app.
